## Build from Source

### Windows

**Prerequisites:** .NET 8 SDK

```bash
cd windows
dotnet build -c Debug          # development
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true    # production EXE
```

Output: `windows/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/LTTPRandomizerGenerator.exe`

### Android

**Prerequisites:** Android Studio or Android SDK (API 34), JDK 17

Open `android/` as the project root in Android Studio and build from there, or:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

> For a signed APK (required for newer Android versions to install without developer options), configure a keystore in `android/app/build.gradle` under `signingConfigs`.

---

## Releases (GitHub Actions)

Push a tag matching `v*.*.*` to trigger automatic builds:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Both Windows EXE and Android APK are built and attached to the release automatically.

---

## How It Works

1. App sends your chosen settings to `POST https://alttpr.com/api/randomizer` (no ROM upload)
2. API returns a seed hash + a URL to a BPS base patch + seed-specific byte patches
3. App downloads the BPS patch and applies it to your local ROM
4. Seed-specific patches (item placement, enemy placement, etc.) are applied on top
5. Cosmetic patches are applied (heart color, menu speed, etc.)
6. Sprite is injected if selected
7. SNES checksum is recalculated
8. Output ROM is written to your chosen folder

Your ROM is never sent to any server.
